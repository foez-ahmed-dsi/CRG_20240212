# Clock MUX 2x1

## Introduction
A Clock MUX or glitch-free multiplexer is a digital circuit component used in electronics and digital systems to select one of multiple input signals and route it to the output without experiencing any undesirable transient pulses or glitches during the switching process. Glitches refer to undesired, short-duration fluctuations in the output signal that occur during the transition between input selections.

Glitches can occur in traditional multiplexers when there is a delay mismatch between the selection control signals and the data inputs. This delay mismatch can lead to temporary signal disruptions or glitches at the output, which can potentially cause errors in downstream digital circuits or systems.

To address this issue, glitch-free muxes are designed with special circuitry or techniques to ensure that the output signal remains stable and free from glitches during input selection transitions. This typically involves synchronizing the switching of the multiplexer with the input data signals or using techniques such as signal conditioning, filtering, or delay elements to mitigate the effects of glitches.
